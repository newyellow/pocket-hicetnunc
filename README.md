This project repo is for issue report and feture requests.  
Make this project open source might be cool, but since I use many 3rd party assets, this could not come true :P

# About Pocket H=N
Pocket H=N is a project trying to improve trading experience on [Hic et nunc](https://hicetnunc.xyz).

Decentralization is cool, but it's painful to reload everything when viewing your collection.

**Pocket H=N is an Viewer App** let you view your collection, track your favorite artist and objkts.

The most important, Pocket H=N download all the preview content from IPFS and store on your device. So you don't need to re-download everything each time you want to check your collection.


**Pocket H=N is also an Objkt** which you can collect and swap. In order to use this app, you need to hold this objkt.

The objkt itself is a #transactionArtb which visualize the trading data within a week. Every trade will become a cube.

* Android / iOS mobile is planned, but not sure when.
